## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
To measure the success is based on onboarding new projects which deploy their projects on the Fantom chain, the speed of transactions, costs for expenses, and if it is envoirement friendly. Fantom has outperformed every competitor by now. Also it is counting, how many wallets are opened and the TVL. TVL and Transaction are increasing massive. 
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Fantom has broken the topp 100, yet is highly undervalued. It's predicted to be on the top 10 by the end of 2021.
Fantom has reached the Top 100 by Marketcap. Comparing to Cardano, Fantom is picking up and the development status of Cardano is by far not at the status of Fantom. So Fantom is undervalued, with a way better technology.
As of today 214k wallets and 15 million transactions. Cardano is at 1 million wallets, and is in the top 5 by marketcap
